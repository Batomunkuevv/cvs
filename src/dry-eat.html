                                    We are the profis. We know vacuum and cryogenic technologies. We have patents for several unique features of our sublimators. And of course, we know how to find the
                                    “sweet spot” between the quality of the sublimated product and its’ cost.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We are producing on a mass scale in a EU member Latvia. We are also designing our machines ourselves. Thus, we keep the costs under tight control and at a very
                                    competitive level.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We know the quality and we never accept compromises. Neither in our work on space projects, nor in our sublimators. You can be sure that all our machines are made
                                    from very reliable components, fully certified in EU, and are using the food grade stainless steel in all parts which could have contact with food. They have also
                                    been designed for cleanability and fast loading and unloading.
                                </p>
                                <p>We provide fast and professional service. In an unlikely case of the machine failure, we consult you on the phone, and if needed, send a technician ASAP.</p>
                                <p>
                                    We can adapt our machines for your needs. Just tell us how you are planning to use it, and we will advise you on the right selection of the machine, will offer you
                                    the auxiliary equipment, will tune the software to the usage mode. We even offer a modular sublimation unit, which you can transport and install e.g. direct in the
                                    field, to work with the freshest products possible
                                </p>

                                    From the position of understanding the balance between product quality and process time, our company has developed a unique method of sublimation and the way of its
                                    technical implementation, protected by the European and international patent PCT/EP2022/066230 "Freeze-drying method and device for its implementation".
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Our company has extensive experience working with deep vacuum and cryogenics, gathered during our work on space projects for ESA and commercial organizations. Based
                                    on this experience, we have a profound understanding of the sublimation process. This understanding and experience resulted in the technology that we can offer you
                                    today within our XL.200 machines and auxiliary equipment.
                                </p>
                                <p>The quality of your product is guaranteed by the design and manufacturing principles that we derived from our own development, research and experimental work.</p>
                                <p>The main ones are:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>The loading area of raw product on the shelf is calculated as 1m2 per 10 kg of weight of raw product (on the basis of fruits and vegetables)</li>
                                    <li>
                                        The calculation of the refrigeration and vacuum system is made on the basis of the need to extract the ice equal to 100% of the weight of the raw product loaded
                                        into the machine
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Each shelf of the machine is equipped with individual sensors, allowing accurate regulation of the freezing process</li>
                                    <li>Components used In our machines are manufactured in the European Union, Great Britain and the United States by leading producers</li>
                                    <li>In the process of assembly, each machine passes several rigorous tests in accordance with the system of quality gates</li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>
                                    The unique algorithms of our control systems allow you to choose the best processes for your needs and adapt them to the balance you need between product quality
                                    and process speed. You do not need to bother about pressures, temperatures and time. Our algorithms know how to achieve your desired balance between time, cost and
                                    quality and will “guide” our sublimation machines to this target set by you.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If you go for highest quality, our sublimation machines can make the product with a shelf life of at least 20-25 years, during which the quality and nutritional
                                    value stay constant.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We offer a complex solution which guarantees that your plant works efficiently, effectively, reliably and can achieve the highest quality of the finished product
                                    while processing the required quantity of raw materials,
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The optimal process of sublimation using our equipment does not cause denaturation of macromolecules and organic compounds, so your sublimated products do not lose
                                    aroma, color, taste and form and preserve up to 99% of useful and healthy bio-substances.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Our freeze-drying machines could be paired with robots to increase productivity and equipped with intelligent control systems that are integrated into a single
                                    Control Room complex.
                                </p>
