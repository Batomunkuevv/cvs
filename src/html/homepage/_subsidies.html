                    main reason to purchase our machines is to make a good business with the products they can produce. Below you can find a couple of examples from our current customers. They are

                                    Strawberries are a delicate product subject to vagaries of the weather. Once the weather is warm and dry, a lot of strawberries ripen in the fields, and the prices
                                    drop. One can choose not to sell at the dumping price to the supermarkets, but rather to preserve the harvest by sublimation. Good quality strawberries make
                                    delicious sublimated strawberries, which command retail prices of 120 Eur per kg and more.
