                    During the sublimation process, the material is cooled and vacuumed to bring it`s liquid (water) below the “triple state point” – the point at which solid, liquid and gas phases of
                    the material coexist. The sublimation process should pass at lower than triple point temperature and pressure. The lower temperature and the pressure – the better dried product´s
                    quality, but the longer the processing time. To find the “golden middle” is the well-kept secret of sublimation technology experts, like us.
